# Stock-Trading-by-Reinforcement-Learning
In this project, to facilitate stock trading decisions, we chose APPLE (APPL) stock as our trading asset and implemented Deep Q Network (DQN), Double DQN and Dueling DQN models to automatically make buy, sell or hold decisions on each trading day. We then compared the performance of the three models on different metrics, such as profit gained, loss function, reward function, etc. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of Dueling DQN in the area of stock market decision making for future investors in the financial markets. Finally, due to the instability and non-robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms, deep learning LSTM models are also trained to make predictions on stock prices to doubly facilitate investment decisions.
